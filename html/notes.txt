 # Introduction to Coding and Programming
 Coding is the process of writing instructions for computers to perform specific tasks. These
 instructions, known as code, are written in various programming languages. Coding is like
 giving step-by-step commands to a computer to make it do what you want.
 Programming is the broader concept that includes coding but also involves planning and
 designing solutions to problems. It includes tasks like analyzing requirements, designing the
 structure of the solution, coding, testing, and debugging.
 
 # Programming Languages and Their Types
 Programming Languages are the tools we use to write code. They have specific syntax and
 rules that must be followed. There are many programming languages, each designed for
 different purposes. Here are a few types:
 1. High-Level Languages: Easier for humans to read and write (e.g., Python, Java,
 JavaScript).
 2. Low-Level Languages: Closer to machine code, harder for humans to read (e.g.,
 Assembly).
 3. Markup Languages: Used to define the structure and presentation of text (e.g., HTML).
 4. Scripting Languages: Used to automate tasks (e.g., JavaScript, Python).
 5. Compiled Languages: Converted into machine code before execution (e.g., C, C++).
 6. Interpreted Languages: Executed line by line by an interpreter (e.g., Python, Ruby).
 
 # Career Paths in Coding
 1. Front-End Developer: Focuses on the user interface and user experience of websites
 using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
 2. Back-End Developer: Works on the server-side logic, databases, and application
 functionality using languages like Java, Python, or Ruby.
 3. Full-Stack Developer: Combines front-end and back-end development skills.
 4. Mobile App Developer: Creates applications for mobile devices using languages like
 Swift (iOS) or Kotlin (Android).
 5. Desktop App Developer: Create applications that runs on desktop

 # How the Internet Works: A Simple Explanation
 The internet is a vast, interconnected network that allows computers all over the world to
 communicate with each other. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of how it works, using key components like
 clients, DNS, servers, and users.
 1. Users and Clients
 User: This is you, the person who wants to access information or services on the internet.
 Client: The device you use to connect to the internet (e.g., a computer, smartphone, or
 tablet). When you open a web browser and type in a website address, your device acts as
 a client.
 2. Domain Name System (DNS)
 Domain Name: The human-readable address you type into your web browser,
 likewww.example.com.
 DNS (Domain Name System): Think of DNS as the internet's phonebook. It translates
 domain names into IP addresses, which are numerical labels assigned to each device
 connected to the internet. For example,www.example.com might translate to 192.0.2.1.
 Process: When you type a domain name into your browser, the DNS server finds the
 corresponding IP address so your client can locate the correct server.
 3. Interconnected Network
  Network: The internet is a global system of interconnected networks. These networks are
 made up of computers, servers, routers, and other devices that communicate with each
 other using standardized protocols (rules for data exchange).
 Routing: Routers are devices that direct data packets (small chunks of data) through the
 internet, ensuring they reach the correct destination.
 4. Servers
 Server: A powerful computer that stores websites, applications, and data. When your
 client requests a webpage, the server processes the request and sends the appropriate
 information back to your client.
 Web Hosting: Websites are hosted on servers. When you visit a website, you are
 accessing the information stored on the server where the website is hosted.
 5. Data Exchange Process
 1. Request: As a user, you type a website address into your browser and press enter.
 2. DNS Lookup: Your client sends a request to a DNS server to translate the domain name
 into an IP address.
 3. Routing: Using the IP address, your client sends a request over the internet to the server
 where the website is hosted. Routers along the way direct the data packets to the correct
 server.
 4. Server Response: The server receives the request, processes it, and sends the requested
 webpage data back to your client through the internet.
 5. Display: Your client receives the data and your web browser displays the webpage for
 you to see and interact with.
 # Visualizing the Process
 1. User: You want to visitwww.example.com.
 2. Client: Your computer sends a request forwww.example.com.
 3. DNS: The DNS server translateswww.example.com to 192.0.2.1.
 4. Routing: Routers direct your request to the server at 192.0.2.1.
 5. Server: The server at 192.0.2.1 sends the webpage data back.
 6. Client: Your computer receives the data and displayswww.example.com.
 This entire process happens in a matter of seconds, allowing you to seamlessly browse the
 internet and access a world of information and services!
