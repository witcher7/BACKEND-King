## 👑 What is this repo?

This is not your average backend codebase.  
This is a **multi-language, microservice-fueled, event-driven, full-stack monster** designed to crush latency, scale like a beast, and make DevOps cry tears of joy.

> 💥 From REST to gRPC.  
> 🔊 From Kafka to Kingdom.  
> 💻 From HTTP to Holy-heck-this-is-good.
